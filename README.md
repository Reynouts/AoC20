# Advent of Code 2020
Solving puzzles of AoC20, probably all with Python. 

Fourth year I'm joining this cool challenge. Goal is just to solve 
every puzzle within the day. Last year I focused on the use of Python and writing 
Pythonic code (check my other repos). 

This year I just solve the problems. Hopefully I can find the time
to complete it.

In this readme, just some notes about the puzzles, my code and other 
solutions I have seen. All solution can be found in this repository.

## [--- Day 1: Report Repair ---](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
Not much to see here.. really easy first puzzle today. The biggest 
challenge today was getting my wifi working. Unfortunately we got an
electrical issue by a short circuit somehwere in the house. Haven't 
figured it out. But managed to get on the internet for a couple of
minutes, which was enough to solve this one!
